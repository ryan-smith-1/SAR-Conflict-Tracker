# SAR-Conflict-Tracker
This project uses open source intelligence data and analysis to discover, track, and verify any targeted topographical changes on Earth. Particularly aimed for usage on geopolitical events such a missile strikes, trench warfare activity, or other such topographic violent events. 

This is done through using ASF Sentinel-1 data, specifically the Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, which allows for topographic feature change detection of at best ~1m in width and ~1m in depth. This means even precision air strikes, small trenches, or even insignificant building demolitions can be detected. Furthermore, the nature of SAR allows for detection through 100% cloud cover since SAR waves can penetrate clouds. 

This project is still a work in progress and the portion that has been uploaded so far is incomplete. There is currently a data retrieval pipeline uploaded, as well as a preprocessing pipeline which aligns, prepares, and validates the data.
